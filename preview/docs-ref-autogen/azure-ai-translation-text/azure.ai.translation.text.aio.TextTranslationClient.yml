summary: 'Text translation is a cloud-based REST API feature of the Translator service

  machine translation technology to enable quick and accurate source-to-target text
  translation

  in real time across all supported languages.

  Languages. Returns a list of languages supported by Translate, Transliterate, and
  Dictionary

  Lookup operations.


  Translate. Renders single source-language text to multiple target-language texts
  with a single

  request.


  Transliterate. Converts characters or letters of a source language to the corresponding

  characters or letters of a target language.


  Detect. Returns the source code language code and a boolean variable denoting whether
  the

  detected language is supported for text translation and transliteration.


  Dictionary lookup. Returns equivalent words for the source term in the target language.


  Dictionary example Returns grammatical structure and context examples for the source
  term and

  target term pair.
